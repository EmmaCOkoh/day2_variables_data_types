# Day 2: Variables & Data Types â€“ My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to Day 2 of my Python learning path! In this notebook, I explored how to store and work with information in Python using **variables** and understood the most common **data types**. These are the building blocks for all programming and future AI/Machine Learning work.

## What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ Variables:
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- How to name and assign values to variables.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Types:
- `int` â€“ whole numbers (e.g., 29)
- `float` â€“ decimal numbers (e.g., 5.9)
- `str` â€“ strings or text (e.g., "Toronto")
- `bool` â€“ booleans (True/False)

### ðŸ”¹ Tools:
- Used the `type()` function to check variable types
- Used `print()` to output data
- Used `# comments` to explain code

## Practice Exercises

### ðŸ”¸ Practice 1: Personal Info Variables  
Stored and printed my name, age, height, and location using variables.

### ðŸ”¸ Practice 2: Type Checker  
Created 5 different variables, printed their values, and checked their types using the `type()` function.

### ðŸ”¸ Practice 3: Fake Bio Generator  
Used variables to build short bio messages that introduce who I am and what Iâ€™m working towards. This is the beginning of a future **dynamic profile generator** for my portfolio.
